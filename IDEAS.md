# Features/ideas to add/tweak
    - translate ["bios"]["bootOrder"]'s values from human readable to qemu readable info (from "disk" to "c"; from "floppy" to "a"; etc.)
    - read a config file and based on that start a qemu vm
    - config file gui (using python3-tk) generator/wizard
    - gui that reads all the vm scripts in a home folder and lets you pick what vm you want to start (something like virtualbox, also tracks if the machine is running)
